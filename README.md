# Hyper Audio

## 🎯 Project Goals

This project aims to create a complete AI-powered audio processing pipeline that can transform podcasts by replacing speaker voices while maintaining natural timing, cadence, and conversation flow. All processing is done locally using open-source AI models optimized for NVIDIA RTX 4090.

2. **Speaker Diarization**: Identify and separate different speakers in multi-person conversations  
3. **Speech Recognition**: Transcribe speech with speaker attribution and timing
4. **Voice Replacement**: Replace target speaker(s) with AI-generated voice while preserving:
   - Original timing and pacing
   - Natural speech patterns and inflection
   - Conversation flow and overlaps
5. **Audio Reconstruction**: Seamlessly blend replaced voice with original audio

### Technical Requirements

- **Hardware**: NVIDIA RTX 4090 (24GB VRAM)
- **Software**: All models run locally using open-source AI
- **Performance**: Real-time or near real-time processing for typical podcast lengths
- **Quality**: Broadcast-quality output indistinguishable from original
