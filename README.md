# Check specific pipeline syntax
python dev_playground_config.py run --name your_pipeline_name
```

**Missing Dependencies or Models**
```bash
# Install core dependencies
pip install -e .

# Install AI model dependencies
pip install "demucs>=4.0.0"      # For voice separation
pip install "speechbrain>=0.5.0" # For advanced separation

# Install all optional dependencies
pip install -e ".[ai-models]"
```

**Stage Verification Failures**
```bash
# Check detailed diagnostics output
python dev_playground_config.py run --name dmx_separation

# Common verification issues:
# ⚠️ Audio may be clipped - Normal for AI separation models
# ❌ Missing outputs - Check stage implementation
# ⚠️ Very low energy - Check input audio quality
```

**CUDA Memory Issues**
```bash
# Force CPU processing for memory-intensive stages
# In dev_playground_config.yaml:
stages:
  VoiceSeparator:
    default_config:
      device: "cpu"

# Clear GPU cache between runs
python -c "import torch; torch.cuda.empty_cache()"
```

##### ⚡ **Performance Tips**

- **Smart Caching**: Results automatically cached and reused - clean `dev_cache/` periodically
- **GPU Optimization**: First run downloads models, subsequent runs much faster
- **Pipeline Efficiency**: Use dependency resolution to avoid redundant processing
- **Quality vs Speed**: Choose appropriate models based on quality/speed requirements

##### 📁 **Recommended Data Setup**

```bash
# Optimal data directory structure
data/
├── dmx.flac                # Example: Electronic music with vocals
├── podcast_clip.wav        # 2-5 minute podcast samples
├── conversation.mp3        # Multi-speaker content
├── music_only.wav          # Instrumental content for testing
└── voice_sample.wav        # Clean voice samples for synthesis
```

##### 🔍 **Debugging Pipeline Issues**

```bash
# Inspect stage outputs and diagnostics
ls -la dev_cache/*/
cat dev_cache/enhancedvoiceseparator_*/metadata.json

# Listen to intermediate results
play dev_cache/enhancedvoiceseparator_*/vocals.wav
play dev_cache/enhancedvoiceseparator_*/music.wav

# Check verification messages for quality insights
# 📊 Vocal spectral centroid: 3968.4 Hz (higher = more vocal content)
# 📊 Music spectral centroid: 1436.5 Hz (lower = more instrumental)
```
