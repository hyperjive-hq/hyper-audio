 Check this pink ribbon off my eyes I'm exposed and it's no big surprise Don't you think I know exactly where I stand? This world is forcing me to hold your hand Cause I'm just a girl, a little lonely Well, don't let me out of your sight Oh, I'm just a girl, I'm pretty and petite So don't let me have any rights Oh, I'm a little lonely
 The moment that I step outside So many reasons for me to run and hide I can't do the little things I love so dear It's all those little things that I fear Cause I'm just a girl that I'd rather not be Cause they won't let me drive late at night Oh I'm just a girl, yes I'm some kind of freak But they all seem to stare with their eyes Oh I'm just a girl, take a good look at me Just your typical prototype
 I've had it up to here
 Oh, am I back in my soul? Clear!
 I'm just a girl.
 I'm just a girl in the world.
 That's all that you'll let me be
 Oh, I'm just a girl living in captivity Your rule of thumb makes me worrisome Oh, I'm just a girl, what's my destiny? What I've succumbed to is making me numb Oh, I'm just a girl, my love for the teen Will I become misobert and some? Oh, I'm just a girl, lucky me, treat all of them, there's no comparison Oh
 I'm burning up too Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh I'm burning up too
